Convert max-cut instances into Pauli list
Deal with Gset format. See https://web.stanford.edu/~yyye/yyye/Gset/
Design the max-cut object `w` as a two-dimensional np.array
e.g., w[i, j] = x means that the weight of a edge between i and j is x
Note that the weights are symmetric, i.e., w[j, i] = x always holds.
