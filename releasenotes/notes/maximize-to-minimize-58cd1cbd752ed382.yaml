    Introduced a new converter class ``MaximizeToMinimize`` for ``QuadraticProgram``.
    It converts a problem to a minimization problem. The converter was added to 
    the default converters list of ``OptimizationAlgorithm``.  Algorithms, which 
    converted problems internally before, are now using ``MaximizeToMinimize``.
